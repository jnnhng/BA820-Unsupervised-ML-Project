Cut to the chase; state your case and get out of the way.  The purpose of writing is to convey a message in the fewest words possible.  This eliminates confusion and keeps the reader's attention from wandering.\\n\\nIt's especially good advice for those memo writers in the world of corporate America.  I spent many years wading through memos that never seemed to say anything although they seemed to last forever; the syntax was downright sinful.  The thought process was often mysterious; it was almost impossible to tell if the writer was happy with something or unhappy.

`vote` variable has a high mean value of approximately 324, which means that this cluster may represent reviews that received a lot of votes.\n","* The `overall` rating averages to 4, with a standard deviation of approximately 1.15, which suggests moderate variation in the ratings within this cluster.\n","* The `verified` mean is close to 0.43, suggesting that less than half of the reviews in this cluster come from verified purchases.\n","* The `price` has a wide range, with a mean of 14.95 and a standard deviation of 13.01, indicating varied pricing for the books in this cluster.\n","* The `total review count` is also a little bit spread out, with a mean of 102.38 and a high maximum value, suggesting some books have a very high review count.\n","* The `year` data suggests that the books in this cluster were reviewed around the year 2009 on average, with reviews spanning from the year 2000 to 2015.\n","* The `day of week` and `month` might represent the time when the reviews were most frequently posted, with averages suggesting that there isn't a strong bias toward any specific day of the week or

review in this cluster is from a `verified` purchase (verified mean is 1.0), suggesting a higher reliability of the reviews.\n","* The average number of votes (`vote`) is quite low at 0.31, which could mean these books are less interesting or do not have as much active engagement in voting as the other clusters.\n","* The books are moderately `priced` on average (price mean of 18.81), with some books priced as high as 245.\n","* A relatively high average total review count (`total review count` mean of 48.58) suggests these books are frequently discussed, with a range that indicates some titles are more popular than others.\n","* The review years (`year`) range from 2004 to 2018, with an average around 2014, suggesting these books maintain ongoing interest.\n","* As with cluster

average rating (`overall`) is quite high at approximately 4.57, indicating that the books in this cluster are generally well-received.\n","* Most of reviews are from `verified` purchases, with a mean of 0.79685, suggesting high credibility.\n","* The mean number of votes (`vote`) is a little bit low at around 0.32, suggesting that these books don't tend to generate a lot of voting activity.\n","* The average price (`price`) is moderate at about 30.23, but there is considerable variability as indicated by the standard deviation of approximately 33.82.\n","* The total `review` count has a high mean of 638.33, suggesting that the books in this cluster attract a lot of reviews compared to others.\n","* The reviews cover a wide range of `years`, from 1998 to 2018, with most of them being around 2013, indicating sustained interest over a long period.\n","* Reviews are evenly distributed throughout the `week` and `year`, with no significant bias towards any particular day or month as the other clusters."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":300},"id":"O2XFcw6qEXWq","outputId":"28b64e5b-9fd1-4a09-8302-ce34330add89"},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"summary":"{\n
