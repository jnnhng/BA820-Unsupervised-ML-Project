Cut to the chase; state your case and get out of the way.  The purpose of writing is to convey a message in the fewest words possible.  This eliminates confusion and keeps the reader's attention from wandering.\\n\\nIt's especially good advice for those memo writers in the world of corporate America.  I spent many years wading through memos that never seemed to say anything although they seemed to last forever; the syntax was downright sinful.  The thought process was often mysterious; it was almost impossible to tell if the writer was happy with something or unhappy.

Through clustering, we identified two groups of power users, those with high verification and those who purchase books at high prices, which can be utilized for customer segmentation and targeting. Via sentiment analysis, we identified top genres, book styles, and titles, which can be fed into recommendation algorithms for marketing strategies, content recommendations, and product development. For instance, tailoring marketing messages based on price points and anticipated sentiment, or customizing marketing and promotional endeavors to resonate with specific genre audiences, can optimize outreach efforts. Moreover, these insights could influence Publishing houses' production decisions regarding the styles of books they choose to produce. Further exploration into specific book categories or sentiment patterns could yield deeper understanding and actionable recommendations. These sentiment scores can also be used in the review interface to give prospective buyers more insights on the book overall.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"q7gsr8DnaXEH"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Appendix\n","\n","---"],"metadata":{"id":"slsCnTFTnBD9"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["This appendix contains code we used and methods we tried that ultimately did not end up in the final version due to various reasons."],"metadata":{"id":"hizqaVKGbWFd"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Below is the code we used to sample the original dataset downloaded straight from the source."],"metadata":{"id":"HuJm8tbchpWv"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"tags":[],"id":"4d2127f0-9924-44f4-890b-643b2de687c8"},"outputs":[],"source":["# import pandas as pd\n","# import json\n","# import random\n","\n","# # Function to read JSON file in chunks\n","# def read_json_in_chunks(file_path, chunk_size=1000):\n","#     with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n","#         while True:\n","#             chunk = []\n","#             for _ in range(chunk_size):\n","#                 line = file.readline()\n","#                 if not line:\n","#                     return\n","#                 try:\n","#                     chunk.append(json.loads(line))\n","#                 except json.JSONDecodeError:\n","#                     continue\n","#             yield chunk\n","\n","# # Function to take a random sample from each chunk\n","# def take_random_sample_from_chunks(file_path, sample_size):\n","#     sampled_data = []\n","#     for chunk in read_json_in_chunks(file_path):\n","#         sampled_data.extend(random.sample(chunk, min(sample_size, len(chunk))))\n","#     return sampled_data\n","\n","# # Main function\n","# def main():\n","#     # Path to your JSON file\n","#     json_file_path = 'Books_5.json'\n","\n","#     # Specify sample size\n","#     sample_size = 100  # Change this to the desired sample size\n","\n","#     # Take a random sample from the JSON file\n","#     sampled_data = take_random_sample_from_chunks(json_file_path, sample_size)\n","\n","#     # Optionally, write sampled data to a new JSON file\n","#     with open('random_sample.json', 'w') as file:\n","#         json.dump(sampled_data, file, indent=4)\n","\n","# if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n","#     main()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"tags":[],"id":"49353956-a546-45fc-adff-0d40cda28ed4"},"outputs":[],"source":["# df = pd.read_json('random_sample.json')\n","\n","# df.head()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Below is the code we used to extract the metadata we needed from the meta data files."],"metadata":{"id":"m4uHq5p8h6bI"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Converting the original metadata on the Books sample for Amazon reviews into a smaller DataFrame\n","\n","The original metadata was a large 3.8GB file with more information than necessary -
