Cut to the chase; state your case and get out of the way.  The purpose of writing is to convey a message in the fewest words possible.  This eliminates confusion and keeps the reader's attention from wandering.\\n\\nIt's especially good advice for those memo writers in the world of corporate America.  I spent many years wading through memos that never seemed to say anything although they seemed to last forever; the syntax was downright sinful.  The thought process was often mysterious; it was almost impossible to tell if the writer was happy with something or unhappy.
